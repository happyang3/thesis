        You will be able to try different prompts and play around with one of the chatbot's settings 
        called the <em>model temperature</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="paraLong"> Your goal is to understand how prompt design and model temperature can influence the 
        accuracy and usefulness of the chatbot's responses. </p>
