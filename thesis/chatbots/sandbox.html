        <h1>Welcome to the Chatbot Simulator!</h1>
        <div id="instructionsContainer"> 
            <p class="paraLongInstruct"> Below, you can ask the chatbot to do various tasks by dragging a prompt from the 
                <span style="color: #1ab4c5;"><strong>Prompt Bank</strong></span> to the 
                <span style="color: #7baf27;"><strong>Prompt Window</strong></span>. 
                The chatbot's response to the prompt will appear in the 
                <span style="color: #dfa32b;"><strong>Response Window</strong></span>.
                To understand why a chatbot might behave in strange and unexpected ways, <strong>try different prompts</strong>
                and <strong>play around with the model's temperature</strong> for each.
                <strong>Note: </strong>The model's temperature is a reflection of how predictable vs. random its outputs are.</strong> 
                Lower temperatures correspond with greater predictability while higher temperatures correspond with
                more randomness. You can change the temperature using the slider at the bottom of the screen. 
                Try out all three of the prompts to continue.

            What happens to a dream deferred?
            Does it dry up
            like a raisin in the sun?
            Or fester like a sore—
            And then run?
            Does it stink like rotten meat?
            Or crust and sugar over—
            like a syrupy sweet?
            Maybe it just sags
            like a heavy load.
            Or does it explode?
            I think Langston Hughes was asking a question that we all need to ask ourselves. What happens to our dreams when we don't pursue them? Do they wither away like a raisin in the sun, or do they fester and become infected, causing us pain and discomfort? Do they become overly sweet and sticky, like syrup, or do they weigh us down like a heavy load? Or do they explode, causing chaos and destruction in our lives?
            These are questions that we all need to ask ourselves, because the truth is, our dreams are a part of who we are. They are the things that drive us, that motivate us, that give us purpose and meaning in our lives. And when we don't pursue them, when we let them go unfulfilled, it can have a profound impact on our well-being.
            So, what happens to a dream deferred? The answer is, it depends. It depends on the individual, on their circumstances, on their mindset. But one thing is for sure, a dream deferred can have a powerful impact on our lives, and it's up to us to decide what we want to do with it.`;

            Or does it explode?
            I think Langston Hughes was asking a question that many people have asked themselves at some point in their lives. What happens to the dreams we have, the aspirations we hold dear, when they are not realized? Do they wither away like a raisin in the sun, or do they become infected and painful, like a sore that won't heal? Or do they become overly sweet and sticky, like syrup, and make us feel sick? Or do they simply weigh us down, like a heavy load? Or, worst of all, do they explode, causing us to feel frustrated, angry, and defeated?
            These are questions that we all must ask ourselves at some point, and they are questions that have been asked by people for generations. Langston Hughes' poem "Harlem" is a powerful reminder that our dreams and aspirations are precious, and that we must do everything in our power to make them a reality, lest they wither away and become nothing more than a distant memory."`;

            The poem "Nothing Gold Can Stay" by Robert Frost:
            Nature's first green is gold,
            Her hardest hue to hold.
            Her early leaf's a flower;
            But only so an hour.
            Then leaf subsides to leaf.
            So Eden sank to grief,
            So dawn goes down to day.
            Nothing gold can stay.
            That's the poem. лаทinate smoke.

            Pure, sweet, and sound,
            The tune of 'When I was in the valley' lingers,
            And maiden-hair will be silver there,
            And in the elders' voices, shaking,
            So slender,
            So slender,
            The Threads of singing in the air.
            The sky is high.
            The wind is free.
            The earth is rich.
            The air is pure.
            The sun is shining bright.
